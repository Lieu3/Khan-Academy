/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app. */

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

CREATE TABLE cronometer(
    id INTEGER primary key autoincrement,
    food_name TEXT,
    serving_size TEXT,
    amount INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO cronometer (food_name, serving_size, amount)
    Values ("Beef Steak", "g", 100);
INSERT INTO cronometer (food_name, serving_size, amount)
    Values ("White Rice","g",100);
INSERT INTO cronometer (food_name, serving_size, amount)
    Values ("Broccoli", "g", 100);
INSERT INTO cronometer (food_name, serving_size, amount)
